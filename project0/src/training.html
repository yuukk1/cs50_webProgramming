  <h1>Dog training</h1>
  Pet owners usually invest in dog training to fix problem behavior
  or brush up on manners, but training can do more than promote polite behavior.
  A few key commands could one day save your dog's life.
  I love it when people ask me about the most important commands
  a dog should know. There are three go-to commands that I believe every
  dog needs to know — for his own safety and the safety of other people
  and canines he comes into contact with.
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h4>Down Stay</h4>
      A dog who immediately drops his body into a ,
      regardless of distance from his owner,
      will be better able to avoid danger.
      Search-and-rescue dogs are taught to respond to this command
      even if they are running at top speed toward a victim
      or are on top of a pile of rubble.
      Pet dogs can see similar safety benefits from this
      training. There are occasions when your dog may find himself
      in a dangerous situation but calling him to you
      could actually create a bigger hazard (for example,
      you're on one side of the street and your dog is
      on the other and there's a car
      coming). Directing him into a down stay can keep him out of the way and
      safe until you can get to him.

      <h4>Drop It</h4>
      Everyday household items can be dangerous for dogs — ladies' underwear
      is a common choking hazard, but other typical offenders include
      chicken bones and apple cores.
      And the most common poison hazards for dogs are human over-the-counter
      and prescription medications — for some drugs, even a single pill
      can have devastating effects on a dog. This is why the "
      command is so important: Unless a dog has been taught to drop
      whatever is in his mouth immediately, he may play keep away and
      swallow the item before you can retrieve it. A dog that
      understands “drop it” will let go of the item, which can then
      be taken away, averting a potential disaster. Dog learning

      <h4>Come When Called</h4>
      Dogs are often happily oblivious to potential threats around them,
      like traffic or poisonous plants, and can easily wander
      into dangerous — or deadly — situations. Teaching your dog to always
      come when can help minimize the dangers for a dog prone to dashing out
      of doors or pulling out of his collar — or one who is simply curious
      about the world around him. Even the best-behaved dogs may find themselves
      in dangerous situations and it is truly risking life or
      death to not instill a reliable recall.
